👋 Hi, I’m @Rahul Prajapati!

👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies and developing software solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced topics in software development and honing my skills in PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter, WordPress, and CRM systems like SuiteCRM and SugarCRM.

💼 I’ve been working in the IT industry for over 1.5 years, gaining valuable experience in developing web applications using PHP and these frameworks.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or interesting software initiatives.

📫 You can reach me via email at test@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prajapatirahul9589) or [GitHub](https://github.com/prajapati-Rahul).
